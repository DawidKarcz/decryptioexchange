# Final Year Project in IADT Dun Laoighre, Bsc (Hons) in Computer Science.

In this final year project in Computer Science at IADT Dun Laoighre, the goal of this online application is to provide a genuine cryptocurrency trading experience simulation in a safe and secure environment. Decryptio Exchange aspires to provide users with a realistic and risk-free trading environment that is synchronised to the most recent exchange rates in order to facilitate their participation in the market.

Please keep in mind that this is a prototype, which implies that some functionality will need to be modified in the future. Nonetheless, the Decryptio Exchange is pleased to deliver a fully working papertrading experience with more than ten supported currencies, with more to follow in the near future.

The way it works : Users will get their first start-up funding in the amount of 10,000 US dollars immediately upon completing registration. From there, you are free to make investments in our supported cryptocurrencies by selling or purchasing at your convenience at any point in the future. In order to make strategic selections, the individual trading charts and exchange history must be considered. Before spending a single penny of real money on a real-world strategy, you may obtain valuable information and experience by practising with Decryptios simulations first.

If you have any problems with the Decryptio Exchange web application, do not hesitate to contact the web application's creator:
